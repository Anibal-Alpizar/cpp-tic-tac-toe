<h1> Tic Tac Toe Game </h1>
<p>This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line with their marker (X or O).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Displaying the game board after each move</li>
  <li>Validating player inputs and preventing invalid moves</li>
  <li>Checking for a winner or a tie game</li>
  <li>Keeping track of the number of wins for each player</li>
  <li>Viewing the results of previous games</li>
  <li>Quitting the program</li>
</ul>
